# Acoustic Guitar-Pitch Detection using Cepstral Analysis Excel-GUI Analyzer
This repository is for the Final Project for Digital SIgnal and Audio Processing Batch 2017-18

### Abstract
Pitch detection of sound is one of the important technologies in audio signal processing. It can be used for interactive computer-music performance. Cepstral Analysis is one of the various Pitch Detection Algorithm. The main focus of this paper is to implement Cepstrum Analysis in detecting the fundamental frequency of an acoustic guitar. The platform used for the project is VBA with an Excel-GUI.

**Key Terms**
*Cepstral Analysis, Cepstrum. Fourier Transform, High-Time Liftering, Pitch Detection*
